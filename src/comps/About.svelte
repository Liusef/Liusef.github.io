            About Me
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Hello! I'm Joseph Liu, a second year undergraduate student at Georgia Tech! I'm currently studying computer
            science with concentrations in Artificial Intelligence and Systems/Architecture.
        <p class="text">
            During the summer of 2023, I will be working with GEICO as a Software Engineering Intern.
            I've also worked with the Georgia Tech Empathy Bytes VIP (Vertically Integrated Project) where I utilized
            Unity and AR/VR technologies to develop interactive experiences.
        <p class="text">
            Beyond computer science and software development, I have experience with media technologies and creative
            applications. Previously, I served as the VP of Media at Lynbrook Robotics, where I learned creative tools
            such as Adobe Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and other Creative Cloud tools.
