    <p class="text">
        Hello! I'm Joseph Liu, a second year undergraduate student at Georgia Tech! I'm currently studying computer
        science with concentrations in Artificial Intelligence and Systems/Architecture.
    <p class="text">
        I've worked with the Georgia Tech Empathy Bytes VIP (Vertically Integrated Project) where I utilized Unity and
        AR/VR technologies to develop interactive experiences.
    <p class="text">
        Beyond computer science and software development, I have experience with media technologies and creative
        applications. Previously, I served as the VP of Media at Lynbrook Robotics, where oversaw many of the media
        related tasks on the team. I'm also proficient in many professional creative programs, such as
    Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Photoshop, Lightroom Classic, and CLIP Studio Paint.
