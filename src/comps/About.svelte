            About Me
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Hello! I'm Joseph Liu, a rising computer science masters student at Georgia Tech with a concentration in Computer Systems. 
            I'm passionate and interested in computer systems, distributed & high performance computing, and machine learning.
        <p class="text">
            Through my coursework and projects I've gained lots of experience with different techniques and
            technologies. Through my systems coursework I've learned about OS design, virtualization, and many aspects
            of distributed system design such as synchronization, distributed memory and storage, and algorithms like
            MapReduce which can be used to parallelize queries to different services. I've learned a lot about AI as
            well, including machine learning, computer vision, robotics, and technologies like Jupyter, NumPy, and
            PyTorch. Through projects, I've also gained experience with web and app technologies like Node.js, React.js,
            React Native, Svelte, and more.
        <p class="text">
            In the summer of 2023, I interned as a software engineer at GEICO, where worked with the Service Enablement
            team. During my time there, I learned more about how companies take advantage of cloud computing and some
            basics with technologies like Kubernetes, Microsoft Azure, and .NET Web Services.
            I audited the company's service portfolio and began work on building a new service portfolio which would
            make it easier to keep service metadata accurate and up-to-date and have better integrations with ITSM and
            other services.
        <p class="text">
            Beyond computer science and software development, I have experience with media technologies and creative
            applications. Previously, I served as the VP of Media at Lynbrook Robotics, where I learned creative tools
            such as Adobe Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and other Creative Cloud tools. In my free time I also do
            photography, illustration, and graphic design.
