            About Me
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Hello! I'm Joseph Liu, a rising computer science masters student at Georgia Tech with a concentration in Computer Systems. 
            I'm passionate and interested in computer systems, distributed & high performance computing, and machine learning.
        <p class="text">
            Through my coursework and projects I've gained lots of experience with different techniques and
            technologies. Through my systems coursework I've learned about OS design, virtualization, and many aspects
            of distributed system design such as synchronization, distributed memory and storage, and algorithms like
            MapReduce which can be used to parallelize queries to different services. I've learned a lot about AI as
            well, including machine learning, computer vision, robotics, and technologies like Jupyter, NumPy, and
            PyTorch. Through projects, I've also gained experience with web and app technologies like Node.js, React.js,
            React Native, Svelte, and more.
        <p class="text">
            In the summer of 2024, I interned as a software engineer at HPE in the GreenLake organization. 
            During my time there, I learned more about how companies take advantage of cloud computing services, and
            how cloud computing tools and cloud native apps are designed and developed.
            I worked with a couple other interns to create a suite of dynamic and static analysis tools for other developers 
            to check their code against the HPE GreenLake developer standards. 
        <p class="text">
            Beyond computer science and software development, I have experience with media technologies and creative
            applications. Previously, I served as the VP of Media at Lynbrook Robotics, where I learned creative tools
            such as Adobe Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and other Creative Cloud tools. In my free time I also do
            photography, illustration, and graphic design.
